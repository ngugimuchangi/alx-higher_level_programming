Interactive test for matrix function

Import module
>>> neo = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Check for normal scenarios
>>> try:
... 	neo([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
[[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0]]

Check for matrix is not a list scenario
>>> try:
... 	neo('hello', 1)
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Check for division by zero
>>> try:
... 	neo([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0)
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
division by zero

Check for wrong data type for div
>>> try:
... 	neo([[1,2],[3, 4]], 'hello')
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
div must be a number

Check for matrix with different row lengths 
>>> try:
... 	neo([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7]], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Check for matrix with wrong data types
>>> try:
... 	neo([[1, 2], [3, 'four']], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...	print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
